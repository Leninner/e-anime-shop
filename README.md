Ropa Shop is a store that offers you high-quality hoodies with a simple and easy-to-use interface.

While building this great project, I had a very good experience. I improved my communication skills to be able to complete my friend's requirements and also improved my Redux knowledge.

I improved my React, CSS and Redux skills a lot, it was really a very challenging project and it helped me a lot to gain a lot of experience.
